# Learning about Frequency Counter

#### Problem #1: Same Frequency 
- Write a function called sameFrequency. Given two positive integers, find out if the two numbers have the same frequency of digits.


#### Problem #2: Are There Duplicates 
- Implement a function called, areThereDuplicates which accepts a variable number of arguments, and checks whether there are any duplicates among the arguments passed in.  You can solve this using the frequency counter pattern OR the multiple pointers pattern.
